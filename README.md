# MOD6-Weather-App
A weather app dashboard

## Description

For this weeks project we had to create a weather Dashboard app that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. The Weather Dashboard will consist of 3 elements. The first will be an input box for you to enter the city's name, the next part will have clickable button for each city. The main part of the screen will display the current date and time, as well as the current temperature, wind speed, and humidity for the current city selected as well as for the 5 day forecast. The Weather Dashboard will pull previous cities you have searched for in local storage. 

- My main motivation was to get everything working. I have the local storage problem fixed, still having problems getting things to render. Im making progress though.
- This project allows you to display weather conditions outside of some formal weather app and all the adds that they generally have. This allow the user to customize the app to suit thier tastes. A future version of this will have a background pic that changes with the seasons or current weather conditions.
- What did I learn? I learned that working with all these different API's and libraries you have to ensure you are calling the right attribute and index point.  
- what makes this project stand out to me is that it uses several different API's.
- I need to study more on API's and rendering

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```

## Installation

There are no special installation steps for this project. All you need to do is clone the repository from GitHub onto your computer.

## Usage

Once you have it in your local repository, on your computer, you can use Visual Studio Code to open the folder. Then you will see the JavaScript.js (currently with my pseudo-code notes in the top half) the index.html, the style.css and other associated files. You can then review the files, preview the script.js, style.css, and the index.html, and then open the index.html in a browser. Click on “Add Employees” to build your own tracker.
